When assessing the proposal based solely on fibre usage, 
it is essential to consider the significant advantages fibre optics provide 
in terms of capacity, speed, and reliability. 
Fibre offers exceptional bandwidth, allowing it to handle large volumes of data with minimal latency, 
which is particularly beneficial for applications that require fast and reliable data transmission. 
The proposal should clearly demonstrate how these capabilities are being utilised to meet 
both current and future demands, ensuring the infrastructure can scale efficiently as needs grow. 
Moreover, fibre optics are less prone to signal degradation and electromagnetic interference, 
making them ideal for maintaining strong signal integrity, even over long distances. 
This reliability reduces the need for frequent maintenance, contributing to long-term operational efficiency.
Although fibre installation can be costlier initially compared to other technologies, 
the long-term benefits, such as durability, scalability, and lower maintenance costs, 
make it a sound investment. Therefore, the proposal should emphasise both the immediate performance
benefits of fibre and its potential to future-proof the network, ensuring it remains sustainable
and cost-effective in the long run.
